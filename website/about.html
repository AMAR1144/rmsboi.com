M. Salgaocar Higher Secondary School is managed by Vidya Vikas Mandal (V.V.M.). The Vidya Vikas Mandal is a premier educational institution in South Goa. It was registered in 1971 under the Societies Registration Act 1860. In 1975, with the introduction of the 10+2+3 pattern of education, the Higher Secondary Section of Damodar College was established. In 1986 the Higher Secondary Section of Damodar College was delinked and renamed as R. M. Salgaocar Higher Secondary School, after the eminent Goan Industrialist and Philantropist Shri R. M. Salgaocar whose valuable donation of Rs. 2,00,000/- made it possible to have an independently functioning higher secondary school.</p>
